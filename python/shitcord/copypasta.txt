    "proprietary": "How dare you fucking use a web browser made by Google. You proprietary scum. It may be open source, but Google has done that to trick you simple minded folk into selling your soul to the advertisers. My father, RMS warned me about people like you. This is why I am so much better then you, a disgusting person that participates in the usage of software that is made by puppet masters. Please do the gnu+linux community a favor by shoving a rusty nail down your esophagus",
    "freesoftware": "As a twenty year old single male I think it's very hard to find a girl who's actually interested in free software. I've had girls jokingly ask to \"Netflix and chill\" but when I tell her that I don't use Netflix since Netflix requires proprietary software to stream content, they stop talking to me. And worse if they do stay they think I'm weird since I blocked google IP's in my host file and we can't even watch youtube. I can't ever seem to get girls to come over to my place and I can't text them either. Once I get their numbers since I've added customs roms to my phone and refuse to use sms since it's a security concern I require all of my friends to download a free and open source messaging app and I share with them my public gpg key so that we can verify that our conversations are secure. None of my friends are willing to do this. And I can't use sites like tinder since it's not only proprietary software but a major privacy vulnerability. How come it is so hard to find a girl concerned about software freedom. I feel like I'm going to be a virgin forever.",
